# Project: COLLEGE BOOKMART

**Description**:  
Designed and developed a website for my college bookstore, aiming to reduce crowd and chaos. The project encourages students to use the campus bookstore by addressing the rush that leads them to seek external options. Features for inventory management, revenue tracking, and automated printing services have been implemented to minimize manual labor. Some aspects of the website are still in progress, with the official deployment pending. Please note that the backend server is currently running on a free service, which may result in slower performance.

**Temporary Deployment**:
